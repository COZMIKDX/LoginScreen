# LoginScreen
I was just playing around with some stuff I learned in class.
Based loosely off of Edward Wong Hau Pepelu Tivrusky IV's computer login screen.
It can take input and perform whatever operations you will with it.

This toy program uses awt and swing for the graphics.

It:
  * Doesn't do anything useful.
  * Doesn't scale.
  * Looks neat.

[2022] I'm going back through some of my old java stuff and figuring out making build scripts and cleaning things up a bit.
